Notes:

1- Get Data From the Local Persistence: I considered 2 approach 
	A- call the get planets API then up to the result I decided to fetch the planets from the Local Persistence or not
	B-  fetch the planets from the Local Persistence, display it, call the get planets API, and after getting the successful response displays the response planets data instead of the local data
    but since there were no specific requirements I did the first approach.

2- Design View:
	A- I add colors Assets to separate it from the main Assets file.
	B- I handled the colors to support dark mode.
	C- I considered images from a google search and I tried to make it look as good as I can.
   since there were no specific requirements for the design, I created it like this.
